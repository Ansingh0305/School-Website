        <p style="font-size: large;">I have actually experienced both good and bad times in thos school which has actually helped me to grow more confident and powerful. Taking part in curricular activities has really helped me improve my skills and the tours on which the school took us actually 
        increased our communicational techniques and all the eduacation and general knowledge has led uss to what I am now. Because of thos school i found out my new abilities. </p>
