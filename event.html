    Then there is the trip in which the children of all classes are taken out, the 7th and 8th graders are taken out of the station like last time i went to nainital where the rocksport company organises all the things required for the kids to comfortable stay there. This trip takes place just after the final exams.
 Eventhough in the time of lockdown the school is teaching us online and every week it is sending new competitions so that children could participate and not get bored.</p>
